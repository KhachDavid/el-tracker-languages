                        We are fellow Chicago residents and CTA 'L' riders who were irritated by the lack of a simple Chicago transit app. One night, we said, \"Why can't I have a widget that shows me when the train is coming?\"
                                    
                        And thus, EL Tracker was born. From there, the idea only grew.  We now have an app that shows arrival times in a simple, user-friendly format, while adding other helpful features like map integration with live train locations, Siri support, multiple languages, and widgets.
                                    
                        This app is not officially endorsed by the CTA. To guarantee reliability we have followed all the developer suggestions laid out in the CTA third-party service API documentation.
